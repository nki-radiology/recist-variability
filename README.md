# Recist Variability with a simulation model

RECIST is grounded on the assumption that target lesion selection is objective and representative of total tumor burdenâ€™s response to therapy. A computer simulation model was designed to investigate the impact of target lesion selection on response assessment. Readersâ€™ disagreement as a function of the total number of lesions, affected organs and lesion growth was analyzed. Disagreement aggravates when the number of lesions increases, when lesions are concentrated on few organs and when lesion growth borders the thresholds of progressive disease and partial response. In a metastatic setting, RECIST displays a highly non-linear, unpredicatable behaviour, not reliable for response assessment due to target lesion selection variability. Including more (if not all) lesions in the quantitative analysis of tumor burden is desirable.

In this repo, we share the code of the simulation model, and the statistical analysis performed in the publication.
